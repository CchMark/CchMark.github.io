Hi my name is Mark.

My dream back then was to build a game plug-in for myself to use.
So that dream affected the rest of my life.
I continued education to the university level and I had a bachelor of Information Technology
and a Master of Network Learning Technology.

Now the reality is I never became a game plugin developer.
But A lot of companies needed a Web site.
So I started working professionally from year 2018.
This time in year {{< currentyear >}} have {{< experienceyears >}} years of experience in the industry along these years.

I hope you enjoyed this CV and I'll see you in the next.
